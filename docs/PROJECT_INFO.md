# Project Information

## About the Project

**Learning Path Analyzer** is an educational data analysis tool designed to help educators and institutions optimize student learning paths by analyzing LMS (Learning Management System) activity logs.

## Problem Statement

Traditional LMS platforms collect vast amounts of data about student activities, but this data often goes underutilized. Educators need actionable insights to:
- Identify which learning activities are most effective
- Understand student engagement patterns
- Personalize learning paths based on data
- Improve overall learning outcomes

## Solution

This project provides:
1. **Automated Data Processing** - Parse and clean LMS logs
2. **Statistical Analysis** - Correlation between activities and performance
3. **Visualizations** - Easy-to-understand charts and graphs
4. **Recommendations** - Data-driven suggestions for improvement
5. **Automation** - CI/CD pipeline for regular analysis

## Technical Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy
- **Analysis**: scikit-learn
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- **Testing**: pytest
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Code Quality**: black, flake8

## Use Cases

### For Educators
- Identify struggling students early
- Optimize course design based on data
- Personalize learning recommendations

### For Administrators
- Track institutional learning effectiveness
- Make data-driven curriculum decisions
- Monitor student engagement trends

### For Researchers
- Analyze learning patterns at scale
- Test educational interventions
- Publish findings based on real data

## Future Enhancements

Potential features for future versions:
- [ ] Machine learning models for prediction
