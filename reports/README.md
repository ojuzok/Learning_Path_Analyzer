# Reports Directory

This directory will contain generated analysis reports.

Generated files:
- `correlation_heatmap.png` - Correlation matrix visualization
- `student_performance.png` - Student performance charts
- `recommendations.txt` - Text report with recommendations

Reports are automatically generated by running:
```bash
python -m src.main
```

Or by the CI/CD pipeline on schedule.
